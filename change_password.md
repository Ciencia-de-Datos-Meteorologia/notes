# Change the root password
In some cases you must want to replace the old password with a new one. It doesn't matter what type of user you are (user or root), the process to update the password is very simple. 
First of all, you must be on a terminal with the `user` session on. Then all you have to do is run the comand
```
passwd
```
Afther this, the terminal will ask you to type the new password. When the message `passswd: password updated successfully` is out, the process is done.
